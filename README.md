You’ve awaken as a cube in a world with domino tiles falling from the sky, being chased by this ominous black cube for reasons unknown. All you can do is run. For some reason you know that the black cube must never catch you. You also know that, when you complete double value domino tiles you gain power-ups that help you run better.
Suddenly a vision, “Get all seven keys to escape…”

## Components:

1 Set of dominoes

4 Six-sided dice

1 Black Cube, 1 White Cube

## Setup:

Shuffle dominoes into a face down draw pile. Take 2 starting dice. Draw and place 5 domino tiles following the 
- Tile placement rule:
-- Connect the tile with its matching space to the end of the previous tile to form a line. If unable, connect the tile oriented from low to high in pip values value. (Ex. in the domino track as illustrated above the 0:5 tile followed the low to high orientation connecting with the 2:4, while the 5:1 connected its 5 to 5:0 tile since it matched.)
- Mulligan: At the start of the game you may draw a new set of tiles if you wish and return the rest.

Place the enemy black cube at the starting space of the line. Count 5 spaces from there and place the your white cube.

## Turn Structure:

1. Roll: You roll your dice pool (starts with 2).
2. Move: Use each dice by it value to move the white cube that many spaces forward paying the pips required by each space (Ex. in the figure above, if you rolled (2) fives, you can use the first (5) to move on the 5 pip space, then use the next (5) to move through the 1 and 4 spaces.)
- If you are unable to fully pay the next space you must stop on the current space.
- Moving through an empty space does not cost pips.
- Once per turn you may combine two unused dice values to use for moving.
- Keys: Whenever you complete a key by moving on the 2nd space of a double value tile, flip that tile face-down as a key and unlock a treasure of your choice:
-- Bonus Dice: Gain a new dice to add to your next roll.
-- Bonus Ability: Draw until you find a non-double non-empty spaced tile from the pile and put it in front of you face-up. Return the rest of the tiles drawn this way face-down. This tile allows the you once per turn to convert a die face of the lower value to the higher value.
3. Enemy: Move X spaces towards the white cube, where X = 2 + the number of keys the you claimed. Whenever the enemy lands on a flipped tile, remove that tile from the line and set it in front of you face-down, the enemy ends its movement on the space where the tile was removed.

Damage: If the enemy catches reaches the your space and you still own a bonus treasure,
sacrifice one of your treasure and return it back to its source. Move the enemy in front of the first tile of the line. If you are unable to sacrifice a treasure you lose the game.

4. Cleanup: 
- Remove all tiles behind the Enemy cube and return it face down to the draw pile. 
- Draw and place tiles in front of the line until X tiles are in front of the white cube  		where X = 2 + the number of keys you control.

Victory: If you controls all 7 keys you win!
